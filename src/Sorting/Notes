Sorting n Integers (Understanding the Brute Force Idea)
Problem Statement

Given n integer values, arrange them in increasing order.

Example:
Input → [15, -1, 3, 8, 2, 6]
Output → [-1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 15]

Brute Force Idea

Generate all possible permutations of the array.

From those permutations, pick the one that is sorted.

Complexity of Brute Force

Number of permutations of n elements = n!

If generating each permutation takes O(n), total work = O(n * n!)

This is extremely inefficient and not practical for large n.

Example (with [3,2,1])

All permutations are:

[3, 2, 1]
[3, 1, 2]
[2, 3, 1]
[2, 1, 3]
[1, 3, 2]
[1, 2, 3]   ← sorted permutation


We filter the sorted one from all permutations.

Key Takeaway

Brute force sorting = Generate all permutations + Pick sorted one.

Time Complexity ≈ O(n!) → impractical.

That’s why we use efficient sorting algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, etc.) with O(n log n).
